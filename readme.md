## Reflection
Throughout this assignment, I delved into the intricacies of REST API functionality and structure, gaining a deeper understanding of how endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication mechanisms work together to create a robust system. As a graduate student, this hands-on experience was invaluable in solidifying my theoretical knowledge with practical application.

Refining and updating documentation proved to be a crucial aspect of the assignment, allowing me to critically analyze existing documentation and improve it based on identified issues. This task honed my skills in communication and attention to detail, ensuring that the documentation accurately reflected the current state of the software and provided clear guidance for future development and maintenance.

Engaging in manual and automated testing provided me with a comprehensive understanding of different testing methodologies, from unit testing to end-to-end testing. By developing and executing test cases and leveraging automated testing tools like pytest, I pushed the project's test coverage towards the target of 90%, reinforcing the importance of thorough testing in software development. Overall, this assignment provided me with valuable insights into collaborative development practices, debugging techniques, and the iterative process of refining software to meet evolving requirements.
