## Reflection
In completing this assignment, I learned a great deal about handling various aspects of a FastAPI application, including user management, authentication with OAuth2, and integrating asynchronous database operations using SQLAlchemy. One of the technical challenges I faced was ensuring consistency in status codes across different endpoints, which I addressed by carefully reviewing each endpoint's behavior and aligning it with the RESTful principles. Additionally, I improved the examples provided in the documentation to ensure they accurately reflected the expected data formats and behaviors.

Collaborating with my team on resolving these issues provided valuable insights into the importance of clear communication and effective teamwork. We utilized GitHub's issue tracking system to organize and prioritize tasks, ensuring that each team member could contribute effectively. Through this collaborative process, I gained a deeper understanding of the importance of code reviews and constructive feedback in improving code quality and maintaining consistency across the project.

Overall, this assignment enhanced my technical skills in building RESTful APIs with FastAPI and SQLAlchemy while also improving my ability to collaborate with a team to deliver high-quality software solutions.
